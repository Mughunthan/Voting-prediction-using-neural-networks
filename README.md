## This study creates and assesses machine learning algorithms, particularly Neural Networks (NN) for predicting voting percentages. Data pre-processing techniques are employed to improve model accuracy. The neural network architecture is detailed, with emphasis on layers and evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) Score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in predicting voting outcomes, contributing to the advancement of secure and transparent voting systems.
